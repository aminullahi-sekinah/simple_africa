Hey, Dean.

00:00:07,776 --> 00:00:09,343
- How long you been back?
- About a year.

3
00:00:09,394 --> 00:00:11,178
- What have you been doing?
- Hunting.

4
00:00:11,246 --> 00:00:13,197
You been back practically this whole time?!

5
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:14,732
You finally had what you wanted, Dean.

6
00:00:14,816 --> 00:00:16,283
I wanted my <i>brother,</i> alive.

7
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:17,951
You wanted a family.

8
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:20,520
You only gave it up because
of the way we lived.

9
00:00:20,572 --> 00:00:22,740
But you had something,
and you were <i>building</i> something.

10
00:00:22,824 --> 00:00:24,958
I need you to go. You're a hunter.

11
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:27,694
And now you know your brother's out there.
Things are different.

12
00:00:27,746 --> 00:00:29,663
- You don't want to be here, Dean.
- Yes, I do.

13
00:00:29,714 --> 00:00:32,333
Me and Ben will be here and...

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,384
you come when you can.

15
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:35,002
Just come in one piece.

16
00:00:35,053 --> 00:00:37,421
And you really think we could
pull something like that off?

17
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:38,439
It's worth a shot.

18
00:00:44,813 --> 00:00:46,013
Castiel: Archangels are fierce.

19
00:00:46,064 --> 00:00:48,365
They're absolute.

20
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:50,150
They're heaven's most terrifying weapon.

28
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:04,865
I'm warning you.

29
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:07,368
Do not leave me here.

30
00:01:07,419 --> 00:01:08,669
I will find you.

31
00:01:10,588 --> 00:01:11,922
What are you gonna do now?

32
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:13,757
- Return to heaven, I suppose.

Because I lie professionally, that's how.

you broke the damn thing

00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,332
but I found zero signs
of hex-work anywhere.

witchcraft was not involved.

00:10:55,873 --> 00:10:58,541
Officer Colfax?

188
00:10:58,626 --> 00:10:59,960
[Scratching]

189
00:11:00,011 --> 00:11:01,962
Hey, man, you all right?

190
00:11:02,013 --> 00:11:03,797
Don't worry about it.

191
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,299
Right.

192
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,835
Look, Officer Colfax... Ed.

193
00:11:08,886 --> 00:11:10,153
Um...

194
00:11:10,221 --> 00:11:13,690
We think that your partner
died of unnatural causes.

195
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:19,229
Did he have any
enemies that you know of?

196
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:20,981
[Groans] You might say that.

197
00:11:21,032 --> 00:11:22,282
Oh, yeah?

198
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,984
Who's that?

199
00:11:24,035 --> 00:11:27,153
They both had it coming. Me too.

200
00:11:27,238 --> 00:11:29,372
I'll be the next to go

201
00:11:29,457 --> 00:11:31,491
and then it'll be over.

202
00:11:33,377 --> 00:11:37,130
And God will be satisfied.

203
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,416
Why does God want you all dead?

204
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,301
'Cause of Christopher Birch.

205
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,804
Oh, damn it.

206
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:46,306
Who's Christopher Birch?

207
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,757
He has no face.

208
00:11:50,828 --> 00:11:51,978
Ed?

209
00:11:53,664 --> 00:11:56,399
Officer, you all right?

210
00:11:57,935 --> 00:11:59,769
Who is Christopher Birch, Ed?

211
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:03,156
Ed!

212
00:12:04,408 --> 00:12:06,942
Christopher Birch is
a kid with no face...

213
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:08,912
and a planted gun.

214
00:12:12,249 --> 00:12:15,785
Uh, you, uh...

215
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,420
You got a little something...

216
00:12:17,505 --> 00:12:18,171
Yeah.

217
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:21,257
Damn.

218
00:12:21,342 --> 00:12:23,309
My head's been itching like a dirty jock.

219
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:29,015
Sam: Ed?

220
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:41,144
Dead.

221
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:42,445
[Buzzing]

222
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:45,982
You hear that?

223
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:48,868
[Buzzing intensifies]

224
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:08,121
Sweet. Blood, boils, locusts.

225
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:11,224
Three of your more
popular Egyptian plagues.

226
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,959
Yeah, but these guys...

227
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,645
ate their way out of a cop's melon.

228
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:17,814
I don't quite remember
that in the King James.

229
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:19,816
Meanwhile, a kid named Christopher Birch

230
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,801
<i>was</i> shot in the head last month

231
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:23,186
after a vehicle pursuit.

232
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,939
Hatch, Gray and Colfax were
the three officers involved,

233
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,575
and they all filed the
exact same police report.

234
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,910
"Suspect exited vehicle
brandishing a firearm".

235
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:33,496
"We were forced to fire."

236
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:37,250
"Just a kid with no
face and a planted gun."

237
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,836
Bunch of dicks.

238
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,821
So they pop the kid, plant the piece.

239
00:13:41,872 --> 00:13:44,874
Maybe Colfax is right.

240
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,794
You know, maybe Heaven has
a hate-on for bad cops.

241
00:13:47,845 --> 00:13:50,380
So we're listening to the guy
with the bug in his custard?

242
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:53,332
That's... that's the, uh,

243
00:13:53,384 --> 00:13:54,767
The theory you want to go with?

244
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,669
Dean, angels got to have
something to do, right?

245
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,721
Now that we're post-apocalypse?

246
00:13:58,806 --> 00:13:59,889
[Bottle cap pops]

247
00:13:59,974 --> 00:14:01,357
Yeah, maybe.

248
00:14:01,442 --> 00:14:02,942
We should call Cass.

249
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:06,479
You're kidding, right?

250
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:10,233
[Scoffs]

251
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,701
Dean, I tried.

252
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:15,572
It was the first and second
and third thing I did,

253
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:17,523
soon as I got topside.

254
00:14:17,575 --> 00:14:19,959
Son of a bitch won't answer the phone.

255
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:22,829
Well, let's give it a shot.

256
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,498
Now I lay me down to sleep.

257
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:29,202
I pray to Castiel to get
his feathery ass down here.

258
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,171
- You're an idiot.
- Stay positive.

259
00:14:31,222 --> 00:14:32,488
Oh, I <i>am</i> positive.

260
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:36,392
Come on, Cass!

261
00:14:36,477 --> 00:14:38,894
Don't be a dick.

262
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,931
We got ourselves a...

263
00:14:42,016 --> 00:14:44,234
Plague-like situation down here.

264
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:46,402
And...

265
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:49,322
do you... do you copy?

266
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,533
Like I said... [clears throat]

267
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:03,269
the son of a bitch doesn't answer.

268
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:09,792
He's right behind me, isn't he?

269
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:16,216
Hello.

270
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:26,999
Hello?

271
00:15:27,537 --> 00:15:28,957
Yes.

272
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,414
[Imitating Castiel] "Hello."

273
00:15:31,481 --> 00:15:33,499
[Normal voice] "Hello"?

274
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:35,918
Uh, that is still the term?

275
00:15:35,986 --> 00:15:37,754
I spent all that time trying
to get through to you.

276
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:39,005
Dean calls once,

277
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:40,707
and now it's [Imitating Castiel] "Hello"?!

278
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:41,674
Yes.

279
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:46,829
[Normal voice] So, what, you...
You like him better or something?

280
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,830
[Scoffs]

281
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,352
Dean and I do share
a more profound bond.

282
00:15:53,437 --> 00:15:55,271
I wasn't gonna mention it.

283
00:15:55,338 --> 00:15:58,191
Cass, I think what he's
trying to say is that...

284
00:15:58,275 --> 00:15:59,809
he went to hell for us.

285
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,011
I mean, he really took one for the team.
You remember that?

286
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:04,480
And then he comes back without a clue

287
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:05,732
and you can't take five friggin' minutes

288
00:16:05,816 --> 00:16:07,116
to give him some answers?

289
00:16:07,184 --> 00:16:08,851
If I had any answers,
I might have responded.

290
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,653
But I don't know, Sam.

291
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:13,573
We have no idea who brought
you back from the cage

292
00:16:13,657 --> 00:16:15,041
or why.

293
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,460
So... it wasn't God?

294
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:20,263
No one's even <i>seen</i> God.

295
00:16:20,363 --> 00:16:23,532
The whole thing remains mysterious.

296
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:24,967
What the hell does <i>that</i> mean?

297
00:16:25,035 --> 00:16:28,254
What part of "I don't know"

298
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:29,972
escapes your understanding?

299
00:16:31,592 --> 00:16:35,011
Cass, look, if Sam calls, you answer.

300
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:36,679
Okay? You wing your ass down here,

301
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,481
and you tell him, "I don't know."

302
00:16:38,548 --> 00:16:41,484
Just because we have some
sort of a... a bond or whatever...

303
00:16:41,551 --> 00:16:43,769
You think I came
because <i>you</i> called?

304
00:16:44,354 --> 00:16:46,655
I came because of this.

305
00:16:47,858 --> 00:16:49,859
Oh, well, it's nice
to know what matters.

306
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,410
It does help one to focus.

307
00:16:51,495 --> 00:16:53,196
Wait, so... so you and the Halo Patrol,

308
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:55,114
you guys aren't the
cause of these killings?

309
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:56,399
No.

310
00:16:56,467 --> 00:16:58,785
But they were committed
with one of our weapons.

311
00:16:58,869 --> 00:17:01,370
There's only one thing that could
have brought this into existence.

312
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,906
You call it the Staff of Moses.

313
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,177
<i>The</i> Staff?

314
00:17:08,245 --> 00:17:11,714
It was used in a dominance
display against the Egyptians,

315
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:12,932
as I recall.

316
00:17:13,016 --> 00:17:14,967
[Scoffs]
Yeah. That one made the papers.

317
00:17:15,052 --> 00:17:17,086
But I thought the staff

318
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:19,438
turned, like, a... a <i>river</i> into blood

319
00:17:19,523 --> 00:17:21,423
not one dude.

320
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:25,094
The weapon isn't being
used at full capacity.

321
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:28,597
I think we can rule
Moses out as a suspect.

322
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:33,202
Okay, but... what is...

323
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,955
what is Chuck Heston's disco
stick doing down here, anyway?

324
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:38,791
I mean, don't you
guys put away your toys?

325
00:17:38,876 --> 00:17:40,459
Before the apocalypse,

326
00:17:40,544 --> 00:17:43,779
Heaven may have been corrupt,
but it was stable.

327
00:17:43,831 --> 00:17:46,799
The Staff was safely contained.

328
00:17:46,884 --> 00:17:48,084
[Sighs]

329
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:51,470
It's been chaos up there
since the war ended.

330
00:17:51,555 --> 00:17:53,589
In that confusion, a number of

331
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:55,791
powerful weapons were...

332
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:57,894
stolen.

333
00:17:57,961 --> 00:18:01,264
Wait, you...
you're saying your nukes are loose?

334
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:04,567
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

335
00:18:04,634 --> 00:18:07,436
But you've stumbled onto one of them.

336
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,789
We must find the weapon that did this.

337
00:18:11,575 --> 00:18:13,693
I need your help.

338
00:18:13,777 --> 00:18:16,812
[Scoffs]

339
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:18,581
That's rich. Really.

340
00:18:20,284 --> 00:18:21,918
[Grunts]

341
00:18:21,985 --> 00:18:23,920
Sam, Dean,

342
00:18:23,987 --> 00:18:27,039
my "people skills" are "rusty."

343
00:18:27,124 --> 00:18:28,591
Pardon me, but I have
spent the last "year"

344
00:18:28,658 --> 00:18:29,926
as a multidimensional wavelength

345
00:18:29,993 --> 00:18:31,878
of celestial intent.

346
00:18:31,962 --> 00:18:33,262
But believe me,

347
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,931
you <i>do not</i> want
that weapon down here.

348
00:18:34,998 --> 00:18:37,350
Help me find it.

349
00:18:37,434 --> 00:18:39,852
Or more people will die.

350
00:18:39,937 --> 00:18:41,053
All right. Okay.

351
00:18:41,138 --> 00:18:43,606
Well, if the angels didn't pull the trigger,

352
00:18:43,673 --> 00:18:46,309
then that brings us back to motive.

353
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,476
What?

354
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,528
Back to the case.

355
00:18:51,481 --> 00:18:53,182
Right now, we got three dead cops.

356
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:55,750
Only thing linking them...

357
00:18:56,737 --> 00:18:58,788
is this.

358
00:18:58,855 --> 00:19:02,858
"Father of slain suspect
calls for investigation."

359
00:19:15,973 --> 00:19:17,173
Boy: Come on, dad.

360
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:18,808
How many times are you
gonna read that thing?

361
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,061
You know what?
We should just throw it away.

362
00:19:22,145 --> 00:19:23,863
Go out back and play.

363
00:19:31,772 --> 00:19:33,439
- Oh, Cass, a little warning next time.
- What the...

364
00:19:33,523 --> 00:19:34,657
How'd you get in here?!

365
00:19:34,724 --> 00:19:36,659
Mr. Birch, settle down.

366
00:19:36,726 --> 00:19:38,327
Federal agents.

367
00:19:38,395 --> 00:19:39,728
But you can't just walk in here!

368
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,080
Quite a collection
you've got there, huh?

369
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:44,500
What are you trying to...

370
00:19:44,568 --> 00:19:46,269
Look, we know the truth, all right?

371
00:19:46,336 --> 00:19:48,504
Chris didn't have a gun on
him when those cops shot him.

372
00:19:48,572 --> 00:19:51,705
- They set him up.
- Yeah.

373
00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:53,960
They're all getting theirs.

374
00:19:54,044 --> 00:19:56,261
And who's giving it to them, Darryl?

375
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:59,215
Darryl?

- <i>Me?!</i>

377

I didn't kill anyone!
Look at how they died!

378

- Yes.

- Yes.

384
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:21,320

385

395
00:20:52,436 --> 00:20:54,520
Aaron. Aaron Birch.

396
00:20:54,604 --> 00:20:57,072
Okay, Aaron Birch,
where did you get this?

397
00:20:57,474 --> 00:20:59,191
- You won't believe me.
- Try me.

398
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:03,028
It was an angel.

399
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:05,664
An angel?

400
00:21:05,749 --> 00:21:07,950
Those liars, they killed my brother,

401
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:09,835
and nothing bad even happened to them.

402
00:21:09,903 --> 00:21:12,204
It's not fair.

403
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:15,674
So I prayed to God every
night he would punish them.

404
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:17,927
God didn't answer.

405
00:21:17,994 --> 00:21:19,495
But <i>he</i> did.

406
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:21,380
His name... did he give you a name?

407
00:21:21,465 --> 00:21:22,748
No.

408
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,967
He just said I could have justice,

409
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:27,436
but I was gonna
have to take it myself.

410
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:30,556
He... he gave me the stick.

411
00:21:32,642 --> 00:21:34,193
He just... gave it to you?

412
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:38,864
Ah, come on.

413
00:21:38,949 --> 00:21:41,067
He didn't just <i>give</i> it to you,

414
00:21:41,151 --> 00:21:43,519
did he, Aaron?

415
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,187
Aaron?

416
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:47,206
I bought it.

417

You <i>bought</i> it? [chuckles]

418

419
00:21:52,462 --> 00:21:54,830
What's your allowance?

420
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:56,499
What did the angel want for it?

421
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,917
What did you give him for it?

422
00:22:00,087 --> 00:22:01,637
My soul.

423
00:22:06,977 --> 00:22:09,595
You sold your soul to an angel?

424
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,347
Can that even happen?

425
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:13,932
It's never happened before.

An angel's buying souls.

427
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:18,437
That could explain why he
cut the staff into pieces.

428
00:22:18,522 --> 00:22:19,572
Why?

429
00:22:19,656 --> 00:22:22,158
More pieces, more product.

430

More "product"? Who is this guy?

- Portability.

Cass, you realize you
just kidnapped a kid?

434
00:22:37,207 --> 00:22:39,074
If the angel we seek truly
bought this boy's soul,

435
00:22:39,126 --> 00:22:41,510
when a claim is laid on a living soul,

436
00:22:41,578 --> 00:22:43,546
it leaves a mark, a brand.

437
00:22:43,597 --> 00:22:46,248
What, like a... like a shirt tag at camp?

438
00:22:47,517 --> 00:22:48,750
I have no idea.

439
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:50,619
But I can read the mark

440
00:22:50,687 --> 00:22:53,139
and find the name of the
angel that bought the soul.

441
00:22:53,223 --> 00:22:54,256
How?

442
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:56,358
Well, painfully for him.

- Physically, minimal.

449

Oh, well, yeah, then by all means,

450
00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:14,109
- stick your arm right in there.
- Dean!

451
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:16,545

ritual to track the angel down.

to let him take over.

491

Balthazar and his weapons

00:30:03,315 --> 00:30:05,766
so... they wouldn't
come looking for me.

547
00:30:05,817 --> 00:30:08,269
What... is all this?

548
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,271
- What are you doing?
- Whatever I want.

549
00:30:10,322 --> 00:30:11,972
This morning I had a ménage à...

550
00:30:12,023 --> 00:30:13,074
What's French for 12?

551
00:30:13,141 --> 00:30:15,576
You stole the staff of Moses.

552
00:30:15,643 --> 00:30:17,978
Sure, sure.

553
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:20,114
I stole a <i>lot</i> of things.

554
00:30:20,165 --> 00:30:23,417
You were a great and honorable soldier.

555
00:30:23,485 --> 00:30:25,202
We fought together.

556
00:30:25,287 --> 00:30:27,821
Yes, too many times to count.

557
00:30:27,873 --> 00:30:29,039
I know you.

558
00:30:29,124 --> 00:30:30,708
You're not some common thief.

559
00:30:30,792 --> 00:30:32,760
Common? No.

560
00:30:32,827 --> 00:30:34,661
Thief? Eh.

561
00:30:34,713 --> 00:30:36,597
I need your help.

562
00:30:36,664 --> 00:30:37,765
I know.

563
00:30:37,832 --> 00:30:39,100
I've been hearing all about you,

564
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:40,885
and as far as I'm concerned,
you and me, Cass...

565
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:43,554
Nothing's changed.

566
00:30:43,638 --> 00:30:45,723
We're brothers.
Of course I want to help you.

567
00:30:45,807 --> 00:30:46,840
Thank you.

568
00:30:48,393 --> 00:30:50,311
I need the weapons.

569
00:30:50,362 --> 00:30:51,779
Don't ask <i>that.</i>

570
00:30:51,846 --> 00:30:53,280
Why take them? Why run away?

571
00:30:53,348 --> 00:30:54,615
Because I <i>could!</i>

572
00:30:55,784 --> 00:30:57,151
What?

573
00:30:57,202 --> 00:30:59,870
What? I me... you're the
one who made it possible.

574
00:30:59,955 --> 00:31:02,406
The footsteps I'm following...
they're yours.

575
00:31:02,491 --> 00:31:05,126
What you did, stopping the big plan,

576
00:31:05,193 --> 00:31:07,128
the prize fight?

577
00:31:07,195 --> 00:31:08,913
You did more than rebel.

578
00:31:08,997 --> 00:31:11,215
You tore up the whole
script and burned the pages

579
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:12,750
for all of us.

580
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:14,701
[Laughs]

581
00:31:14,753 --> 00:31:17,004
It's a new era.

582
00:31:17,055 --> 00:31:19,373
No rules, no destiny,

583
00:31:19,424 --> 00:31:23,511
just utter and complete freedom.

584
00:31:23,562 --> 00:31:25,379
- And this is what you do with it?
- Hey, screw it, right?

585
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:28,182
I mean, dad's not coming back.

586
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:31,485
You might as well blow
coke and jump on the bed.

587
00:31:31,553 --> 00:31:33,187
You proved to me we could do anything,

588
00:31:33,238 --> 00:31:36,907
so I'm trying <i>everything.</i>

589
00:31:36,992 --> 00:31:38,892
What difference does it make?

590
00:31:38,944 --> 00:31:42,997
Of course it makes a diff...
It's civil war up there!

591
00:31:43,064 --> 00:31:44,198
I know.

592
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:46,951
If we can beat Raphael,
we can end this!

593
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:49,286
Just give me the weapons.
[laughs]

594
00:31:49,371 --> 00:31:51,205
Do you know what's funny about you?

595
00:31:51,256 --> 00:31:53,624
You actually believe that
you can stop the fighting.

596
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:59,547
It will never stop.

597
00:31:59,598 --> 00:32:01,882
My advice... grab something valuable

598
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:03,367
and fake your own death.

599
00:32:05,303 --> 00:32:06,420
You've gone insane.

600
00:32:09,391 --> 00:32:11,275
Your little holiday is over.

601
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:13,711
Raphael knows you're alive by now.

602
00:32:13,778 --> 00:32:15,896
Oh, Raphael can try me anytime.

603
00:32:15,947 --> 00:32:17,598
I'm armed.

604
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:19,233
I'm sorry, Cass.

605
00:32:19,284 --> 00:32:21,652
All else aside, I'm really,
really happy to see you.

606
00:32:21,736 --> 00:32:23,988
Even though you still have
that stick up your ass.

607
00:32:24,072 --> 00:32:25,372
[Thunder crashes]

608
00:32:28,276 --> 00:32:29,159
Was that you?

609
00:32:30,612 --> 00:32:32,947
Oh, that's my cue then.

610
00:32:33,014 --> 00:32:35,933
Tell, uh, Raphael to bite me.

611
00:32:36,001 --> 00:32:37,585
[Thunder crashes]

612
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,509
Watch them. They're all snakes.

613
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,689
Sam: Hey, there.

614
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,992
Yeah, I got one of those, too.

615
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:09,861
You think you can
knife fight an angel?

616
00:33:09,929 --> 00:33:11,246
Who's fighting?

617
00:33:11,313 --> 00:33:13,198
Peace out, douche-wad.

618
00:33:18,187 --> 00:33:19,371
[Thunder crashes]

619
00:33:25,761 --> 00:33:27,212
You're making a mistake.

620
00:33:27,263 --> 00:33:29,347
Please. There is another way.

621
00:33:29,415 --> 00:33:31,466
Brother, please.
I don't want to hurt you.

622
00:33:34,186 --> 00:33:35,136
[Screams]

623
00:33:40,276 --> 00:33:42,861
Why won't any of you listen?

624
00:33:42,928 --> 00:33:45,447
[Grunts] They don't listen, Castiel,

625
00:33:45,531 --> 00:33:47,365
because their hearts are mine.

626
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,439
[Groans]

627
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,624
[Grunting]

628
00:34:10,056 --> 00:34:11,056
[Groans]

629
00:34:11,123 --> 00:34:12,974
[Thunder crashes]

630
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,517
[Breathing heavily]

631
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,806
Somehow, I don't think

632
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:31,159
God will be bringing
you back this time.

633
00:34:31,243 --> 00:34:33,361
Balthazar: Hey!

634
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,696
Look at my junk.

635
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,832
No.

636
00:34:40,786 --> 00:34:42,036
[Salt clatters]

637
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,497
[Chuckles]

638
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,799
Same thing happened to Lot's wife.

639
00:34:54,867 --> 00:34:58,520
Iodize the poor sucker,
and your kitchen is stocked for life.

640
00:34:58,604 --> 00:34:59,804
[Laughs]

641
00:34:59,855 --> 00:35:01,389
You came back.

642
00:35:01,457 --> 00:35:05,026
Well, now Raphael will have to
go shopping for a new vessel.

643
00:35:05,094 --> 00:35:07,529
Should give me a nice
long head start on him.

644
00:35:07,613 --> 00:35:09,697
Until next time.

645
00:35:09,782 --> 00:35:11,549
Next time.

646
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,153
Dean: No time like the present.

647
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,825
Holy fire.

648
00:35:20,876 --> 00:35:23,928
You hairless ape! Release me!

649
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,947
First you're taking your marker
off of Aaron Birch's soul!

650
00:35:26,015 --> 00:35:27,265
Am I?!

651
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,666
Sam?!

652
00:35:28,717 --> 00:35:31,136
Unless you like your
wings extra crispy,

653
00:35:31,203 --> 00:35:32,971
I'd think about it.

654
00:35:33,038 --> 00:35:36,057
Castiel, I stood for you in heaven.

655
00:35:36,142 --> 00:35:37,759
- Are you gonna let...
- Castiel: I believe...

656
00:35:37,827 --> 00:35:40,562
the hairless ape has the floor.

657
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,485
[Laughs] Very well.

658
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,506
[Inhales sharply]

659
00:35:53,225 --> 00:35:55,193
[Exhales deeply]

660
00:35:59,582 --> 00:36:02,951
The boy's debt is cleared.
His soul is his own.

661
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,619
Why you buying up human souls, anyway?

662
00:36:04,703 --> 00:36:05,787
In this economy?

663
00:36:05,871 --> 00:36:08,022
It's probably the only
thing worth buying.

664
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:11,342
Do you have any
idea what souls are worth?

665
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,961
What power they hold?

666
00:36:16,615 --> 00:36:19,350
Now... release me.

667
00:36:20,919 --> 00:36:23,021
Suck it, ass clown.
Nobody said anything...

668
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,409
Cass, what the hell?

669
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,278
My debt to you is cleared.

670
00:36:30,362 --> 00:36:32,180
Fair enough.

671
00:36:34,783 --> 00:36:36,184
Cass, are you out of your mind?!

672
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:39,687
Cass?!

673
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:46,044
Oh, friggin' angels! Come on!

674
00:36:53,036 --> 00:36:55,456
Yeah, well I didn't realize I
had this much stuff back here.

675
00:36:55,542 --> 00:36:57,492
Sam: Well, I need some space.

676
00:36:57,544 --> 00:36:59,627
Kind of picked up some
stuff along the way.

677
00:36:59,796 --> 00:37:01,797
[Both exhale sharply]

678
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:06,385
What the hell is that?

679
00:37:06,469 --> 00:37:08,103
Oh, it's, uh, Ben's Halloween costume.

680
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,106
Wendigo?

681
00:37:11,174 --> 00:37:12,224
Yeah.

682
00:37:12,309 --> 00:37:14,809
[Both chuckle] Accurate.

683
00:37:19,366 --> 00:37:21,483
Hey, so, uh...

684
00:37:23,036 --> 00:37:24,820
Are you okay?

685
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:27,373
Me?

686
00:37:27,457 --> 00:37:28,774
[Chuckling] Yeah, I'm great.

687
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,745
Really? 'Cause there's been a few
times that you got me wondering.

688
00:37:35,048 --> 00:37:36,549
Come again?

689
00:37:36,616 --> 00:37:38,067
Well, like where were you
when Cass was, uh,

690
00:37:38,134 --> 00:37:40,102
giving the Holy taser treatment
to that kid?

691
00:37:42,055 --> 00:37:43,722
I was right there.

692
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:44,957
Really?

693
00:37:45,025 --> 00:37:46,258
'Cause honestly,

694
00:37:46,326 --> 00:37:48,927
I felt like I was the
only one raising a card.

695
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:50,095
Right.

696
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,848
Uh, I mean, I was with you,

697
00:37:52,916 --> 00:37:54,767
but... I don't know.

698
00:37:54,834 --> 00:37:56,852
We... we needed the Intel.

699
00:37:56,903 --> 00:37:58,404
Yeah, I know, but we
tortured that kid to get it.

700
00:37:59,606 --> 00:38:00,856
[Sighs]

701
00:38:00,907 --> 00:38:02,858
I just didn't get
the feeling that you...

702
00:38:02,909 --> 00:38:04,826
that you even cared.

703
00:38:07,697 --> 00:38:08,981
You're wrong.

704
00:38:12,335 --> 00:38:15,371
Man, I'm just trying to
figure this out because...

705
00:38:15,422 --> 00:38:16,872
Something's different with you.

706
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,007
You know that.

707
00:38:18,074 --> 00:38:19,458
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

708
00:38:19,542 --> 00:38:21,627
Really?

709
00:38:21,711 --> 00:38:22,678
Yeah.

710
00:38:22,745 --> 00:38:23,963
I mean...

711
00:38:24,047 --> 00:38:25,764
[Chuckles]

712
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:30,135
I've been hunting nonstop
for the past year,

713
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,303
kind of...

714
00:38:31,354 --> 00:38:33,806
Kind of out in the wild, you know?

715
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:38,427
So, yeah, I suppose I'm a
little rough around the edges.

716
00:38:38,478 --> 00:38:39,812
Yeah, I get that.

717
00:38:42,598 --> 00:38:46,068
I just don't think I'm
getting the whole scoop.

718
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:47,903
You went to hell, Sam.

719
00:38:47,954 --> 00:38:50,623
And believe me,
I know what that does to a guy.

720
00:38:50,707 --> 00:38:52,274
To you.

721
00:38:52,342 --> 00:38:53,659
What?

722
00:38:53,743 --> 00:38:55,411
You know what it does to <i>you.</i>

723
00:38:55,462 --> 00:38:58,530
It... it tortured <i>you.</i>

724
00:38:58,598 --> 00:38:59,865
You know?

725
00:38:59,933 --> 00:39:02,468
I think it still does.

726
00:39:02,552 --> 00:39:05,787
But, Dean...

727
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,222
I'm okay.

728
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:08,641
So you're saying, what,

729
00:39:08,725 --> 00:39:10,843
that... that you're stronger than me?

730
00:39:10,927 --> 00:39:12,094
[Chuckling] No.

731
00:39:12,145 --> 00:39:14,346
Just saying we're different.

732
00:39:24,941 --> 00:39:26,241
[Sighs]

733
00:39:26,309 --> 00:39:28,160
[Car door closes]

734
00:39:47,764 --> 00:39:49,214
Monsters lately.

735
00:39:49,299 --> 00:39:51,383
Is it me or is it weird?

736
00:39:51,468 --> 00:39:52,501
[Machinery rattling]

737
00:39:54,437 --> 00:39:55,337
Woman: Look out!

738
00:39:58,475 --> 00:40:00,192
Vampires? [scoffs]

739
00:40:00,276 --> 00:40:01,977
These aren't vampires, man.

740
00:40:02,028 --> 00:40:03,395
These...

741
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,064
These are douche bags.

742
00:40:12,205 --> 00:40:13,956
Explain to me what's going on out there.

743
00:40:14,023 --> 00:40:15,824
Lis, I can't bring
this crap home to you.

744
00:40:15,892 --> 00:40:17,025
You're talking about your work.

745
00:40:17,077 --> 00:40:18,193
I'm talking about my life.

746
00:40:20,163 --> 00:40:22,697
Anyone in town who asks
aloud for the truth,

747
00:40:22,749 --> 00:40:23,865
invokes Veritas.

748
00:40:23,917 --> 00:40:24,866
And she doesn't just give it to you,

749
00:40:24,918 --> 00:40:26,752
she slams you with it.

750
00:40:26,836 --> 00:40:29,888
- Whoa, why the hell <i>am</i> I telling you this?
- Because I'm cursed.

751
00:40:29,973 --> 00:40:32,558
I'm saying I asked for the truth
and, uh, guess what?

752
00:40:32,642 --> 00:40:33,842
I'm getting it.

753
00:40:33,893 --> 00:40:35,894
So, like I said,
I have a few questions for you.

754
00:40:35,979 --> 00:40:37,396
Dean, you all right?

755
00:40:37,464 --> 00:40:38,380
It's Sam, Bobby.

756
00:40:39,715 --> 00:40:41,683
You got my back.

757
00:40:41,735 --> 00:40:43,736
No matter what happens,
I can always count on you,

758
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,937
right, Sammy?

759
00:40:45,021 --> 00:40:47,055
Yeah.

760
00:40:47,107 --> 00:40:48,524
Of course, Dean.
